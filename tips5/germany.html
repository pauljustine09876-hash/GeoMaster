Notably, you can commonly find black or dark grey sign backs, which are rather rare in Europe. Most signs will also feature this sticker, with an upside-down red triangle on a black rectangle.

NOTE: Italy, Romania and Albania also have black sign backs, however landscape should be sufficient to tell them apart.</span><div class="v18_31"></div><span class="v18_26">All car coverage in Germany is made with a Generation 4 camera.

NOTE: There are some Generation 2 and 3 trekkers, and spill coverage with older dates</span><div class="v18_20"></div><span class="v18_16">Germany uses these black and white bollards, with white and light-grey reflectors. The reflector will be orange on bollards next to intersections. They sometimes have plates containing the road number, and potentially other useful information. Many bollards also feature blue attachments on the side.

NOTE: Many European countries have similar bollards, however most will have different coloured reflectors. Luxembourg uses almost identical bollards, but they have 3 bolts instead of 2 on the reflector.</span><div class="v18_33"></div><div class="v18_37"></div><span class="v18_19">GERMANY
