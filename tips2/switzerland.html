They can be either wedge-shaped or cylindrical with a rounded top.

NOTE: Liechtenstein uses almost identical round bollards.</span><span class="v11_2">Chevrons are black with a white arrow. You may also rarely find chevrons that are white with a black arrow.

NOTE: Austrian chevrons are red and white, or red and yellow.</span><div class="v1_1045"></div><span class="v1_1047">SWITZERLAND</span><div class="v10_9"></div><div class="v10_16"></div><span class="v10_18">Swiss licence plates differ substantially from other European plates. They are fully white and lack the blue strip found in most other European countries.

Front plates are extremely short compared to most in Europe. 

Rear plates can be either long or tall. In both cases the red country emblem can be seen on the left, while the canton emblem can be seen on the right.</span><span class="v10_22">Swiss pedestrian signs have seven stripes, making it almost unique for Europe. Furthermore, rather than the typical European square shape, the signs appear as tall blue rectangles.

NOTE: Liechtenstein uses identical signs.</span><span class="v11_9">The colour of directional signs indicates which type of road you are on. Main road signs will be blue, while side roads are white.

Major place names will frequently appear on blue signs, while smaller places tend to be on white signs. However, you can still find large city names on a white sign.</span><span class="v11_10">© 2025 GeoMaster</span><span class="v10_14">By far the most important way to recognize Switzerland, is that all car coverage is low-cam. This means that the camera on the Google car is intentionally set up lower than in most other countries. This can be recognized in two ways:
The car blur is significantly bigger. 
Roads look wider and objects around you are seen from a lower angle.
Generally, the bigger car blur is the most consistent way to recognize low-cam.

NOTE: The only other countries that always have low-cam are Japan and Liechtenstein.</span><div class="v10_24"></div><span class="v10_26">Swiss and Alpine architecture in general largely consists of stone buildings painted in light and warm colours, often combined with wooden parts and details. Roofs are typically tiled and of a gable type. It is extremely common for windows to have wooden shutters which open horizontally in two parts.</span><div class="v10_28"></div><div class="v11_7"></div><div class="v13_12"></div><div class="v13_9"></div><div class="v13_3"></div></div></body></html>
