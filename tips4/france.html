The roofs will typically have a simple gable design, with orange tiles or less commonly black slates. Townhouses will often lay wall to wall along the road.

Do note that France has some of the most diverse regional architecture of any European country, so don’t be surprised to see towns that look significantly different from the previously described architecture.</span><div class="v24_77"></div><span class="v24_82">House numbers in France are most commonly blue, typically written in a serif font with slightly exaggerated shapes. This is most useful when differentiating from Italy, which almost never uses blue house number signs.  NOTE: Similar designs can be found in all other neighbouring, as well as many other, countries.</span><div class="v18_30"></div><span class="v18_24">Pedestrian crossing signs in France have five stripes and a disconnected head on the person. They have the usual white border of French traffic signs.

Less commonly, you can find a design with two dashed lines instead of stripes.</span><div class="v18_29"></div><span class="v18_17">France uses chevrons with white arrows on a blue background. They can have a wide amount of arrows, ranging from one to five.

NOTE: The only other European country with this colour scheme is Spain, where you will only find chevrons with two or four arrows.</span><div class="v18_27"></div><span class="v18_28">Many traffic signs in France have flat rectangular signposts.
Signposts, along with signbacks, can be dyed with unorthodox colours, more so than in other countries. Some of those are regional, which you can learn more about in the regionguessing section.

NOTE: The only other European countries with flat signposts are Portugal, Spain, and Andorra.</span><div class="v18_40"></div><span class="v18_23">Small blue rectangular markings on utility poles are unique to France. They are often referred to as ‘stickers’ by the community, but are actually small plates.

You will find these plates on almost all wooden and metallic poles, but not as often on ladder poles.</span><div class="v18_21"></div><span class="v18_22">Less common wedge-shaped bollards with wide rectangular white reflectors on both the front and back are also unique to France.</span><div class="v18_31"></div><span class="v18_26">A different round white bollard, with two reflective indented bands, is unique to France.

You can also find this design in other colours like green or yellow.</span><div class="v18_20"></div><span class="v18_16">The French bollard is extremely recognizable and appears very often. It is a round white post with a pointed top and a reflector band going all the way around. The band can be grey or red. Some rare variations have a fully red top. 

NOTE: A bollard that is commonly found in Scotland looks similar, but has a blunt top instead of a pointed one.</span><div class="v18_33"></div><div class="v18_37"></div><span class="v18_19">FRANCE</span></div></body></html>
