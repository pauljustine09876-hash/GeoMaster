Urban architecture is usually modern and made of concrete and bricks, while suburban buildings are commonly freestanding single family houses built of either wood or brick.</span><div class="v24_80"></div><span class="v24_74">These wooden electricity markers, with a blue and a white stripe at the top, are often found near utility poles and pylons, and are not found in any other Nordic country.</span><div class="v24_77"></div><span class="v24_82">The outer road lines on highways look solid from a distance, but are typically divided into small sections with a unique pattern, which is different from the solid lines in Finland and Norway. Road lines in Denmark can have a similar pattern, however the individual sections should be rectangular.</span><div class="v18_30"></div><span class="v18_24">Signposts will often have striped markings. Blue and white, and red and yellow are the two most common, but you can also find other colours such as blue and red or white and red.

NOTE: Blue and white markings can be found in several other countries, such as Finland and Estonia, however the other colour schemes are essentially unique to Sweden.</span><div class="v18_29"></div><span class="v18_17">Sweden is the only country in Europe whose chevrons have yellow arrows on a blue background.

NOTE: While very rare, yellow on blue chevrons also exist in Luxembourg.</span><div class="v18_27"></div><span class="v18_28">Swedish road signs have a red border and a yellow background.

NOTE: Finnish road signs have a thin yellow border outside the red one.</span><div class="v18_40"></div><span class="v18_23">Swedish pedestrian signs have four stripes. There is notably a version featuring a female silhouette.

NOTE: Finnish and Danish pedestrian signs have five stripes. Norwegian pedestrian signs usually have four stripes, but can also have five.</span><div class="v18_21"></div><span class="v18_22">Swedish utility poles are usually wooden and can have a variety of poletops. There is commonly a small black metal cap on the very top, which is only found in Nordic countries.
NOTE: Norway and Finland also use primarily wooden poles.</span><div class="v18_31"></div><span class="v18_26">Snow poles are typically orange, with a tall white reflector slightly above the middle of the pole. Some poles have a second, thinner reflector above the normal one.

NOTE: Finland and Norway both have similar orange snow poles. The reflector on Finnish poles is usually much thinner and very close to the top. Norwegian poles typically have either one or two slightly thinner reflectors, with one commonly being very close to the middle.</span><div class="v18_20"></div><span class="v18_16">Swedish bollards are black-and-white, typically with a grey reflector. Reflectors by intersections are commonly orange instead. They can be either wedge-shaped, round, or thin and curved.</span><div class="v18_33"></div><div class="v18_37"></div><span class="v18_19">SWEDEN</span></div></body></html>
